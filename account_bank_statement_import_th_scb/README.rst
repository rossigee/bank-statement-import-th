Import Siam Commercial Bank Statement
=====================================

This module adds support for the import of bank statements downloaded from Siam Commercial Bank website.

As there is no 'download' facility, this is achieved by cutting and pasting the table from the webpage (including the header row) into a `.txt` file, and importing that.
